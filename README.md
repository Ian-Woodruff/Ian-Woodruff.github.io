Design Decisions:

  My website loosely takes advantage of the f pattern in the about, tour, and awards pages on my site. The visual hierarchy of 
  each page is established by the title in the header and the subheadings within the content of the about, tour, and awards
  pages. With size, I convey the importance of the titles and subheadings. I used alignment to create a recognizable structure 
  on each page, with the links to the left, the content of the page to the right, and the header at the top. I tried to use 
  colors that were aesthetically appealing in combination, but also offered contrast between the background and foreground.
  I decided to make decisions that made my website look smooth and sleek, just like my imaginary artist homeboy. I think the 
  decisions made in my site creation will appeal to homeboy's audience because I tried my best to make the website look 
  trendy and hip. I was inspired by minimalistic sites that some artists have designed. An example of this kind of site is 
  Frank Ocean's "blonded.co." There are no known bugs in my code.

Challenge:
  This assignment was incredibly challenging for me. I had to learn a new markup language (html) and a new style sheet language
  (css). I also had to figure out how to download a version of ruby that was accepted by jekyll using the ruby version manager
  (RVM) which was a real pain to figure out. After I completed my site, figuring out git pages also took me a substantial amount
  of time. 
  Regarding the ways I challenged myself within the design of the website itself, I made a few key decisions which I think went
  above what was easy to accomplish on this project. The first of these decisions was to create a link within a picture on my 
  landing page. The second of these decisions was to use a layout that went beyond just top to bottom input flow. I really wanted
  to make my site look as professional as possible, and I think I did a decent job. The third of these decisions was using css 
  styling to make sure my webpage worked for varying browser window size and mobile devices. Although it does look pretty decent
  on mobile devices, I don't think I have the skills to make it look as good as I want it yet. 
  
Credits: 
  I used the HTML tutorials on w3schools.com to help me with html style and formatting basics. This site also taught me how to 
  use css. I used the documentation on the ruby version manager to figure out how to download my new ruby version. The video
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFjuX4VZmU saved me because I was very lost on how to upload my project using github pages. 
  I was not able to track down the origin of the image of homeboy I found because I found it on twitter months ago and just had it 
  screenshotted.
